	  Say Y here if you want to compile in powerdomain layer
	  debugging messages for OMAP2/3.   These messages can
	  provide more detail as to why some powerdomain calls
	  may be failing, and will also emit a descriptive message
	  for every powerdomain register write.  However, the
	  extra detail costs some memory.

config OMAP_SMARTREFLEX
	bool "SmartReflex support"

	help
	  Say Y if you want to enable SmartReflex.

	  SmartReflex can perform continuous dynamic voltage
	  scaling around the nominal operating point voltage
	  according to silicon characteristics and operating
	  conditions. Enabling SmartReflex reduces power
	  consumption.

	  Please note, that by default SmartReflex is only
	  initialized. To enable the automatic voltage
	  compensation for VDD1 and VDD2, user must write 1 to
	  /sys/power/sr_vddX_autocomp, where X is 1 or 2.

config OMAP_SMARTREFLEX_TESTING
	bool "Smartreflex testing support"
	depends on OMAP_SMARTREFLEX
	default n
	help
	  Say Y if you want to enable SmartReflex testing with SW hardcoded
	  NVALUES intead of E-fuse NVALUES set in factory silicon testing.

	  In some devices the E-fuse values have not been set, even though
	  SmartReflex modules are included. Using these hardcoded values set
	  in software, one can test the SmartReflex features without E-fuse.

	  WARNING: Enabling this option may cause your device to hang!

config OMAP_RESET_CLOCKS
	bool "Reset unused clocks during boot"
	depends on ARCH_OMAP
	help
	  Say Y if you want to reset unused clocks during boot.
	  This option saves power, but assumes all drivers are
	  using the clock framework. Broken drivers that do not
	  yet use clock framework may not work with this option.
	  If you are booting from another operating system, you
	  probably do not want this option enabled until your
	  device drivers work properly.

          Say Y, if you want to have support for reporting of GPIO
          switches (e.g. cover switches) via sysfs. Your bootloader has
          to provide information about the switches to the kernel via the
          ATAG_BOARD mechanism if they're not defined by the board config.

          Pin multiplexing support for OMAP boards. If your bootloader
          sets the multiplexing correctly, say N. Otherwise, or if unsure,
          say Y.

config OMAP_MUX_DEBUG
	bool "Multiplexing debug output"
        depends on OMAP_MUX
        help
          Makes the multiplexing functions print out a lot of debug info.
          This is useful if you want to find out the correct values of the
          multiplexing registers.

config OMAP_MUX_WARNINGS

        help
	  Choose Y here to warn whenever driver initialization logic needs
	  to change the pin multiplexing setup.  When there are no warnings
	  printed, it's safe to deselect OMAP_MUX for your product.

config OMAP_MCBSP

	  Select this option if you want to enable the OMAP 32KHz timer.
	  This timer saves power compared to the OMAP_MPU_TIMER, and has
	  support for no tick during idle. The 32KHz timer provides less
	  intra-tick resolution than OMAP_MPU_TIMER. The 32KHz timer is
	  currently only available for OMAP16XX, 24XX and 34XX.

	range 1 12
	default 1
	help
	  Linux uses one of the twelve on-board OMAP GPTIMER blocks to generate
	  system tick interrupts.  The twelve GPTIMERs have slightly
	  different powerdomain, source clock, and security properties
	  (mostly documented in the OMAP3 TRMs) that can affect the selection
	  of which GPTIMER to use.  The historical default is GPTIMER1.
	  If CONFIG_OMAP_32K_TIMER is selected, Beagle may require GPTIMER12
	  due to hardware sensitivity to glitches on the OMAP 32kHz clock
	  input.
